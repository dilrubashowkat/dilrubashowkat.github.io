## BIO
I am a Ph.D candidate in the Khoury College of Computer Science department at Northeastern University. I am advised by Professor [Alexandra To](https://camd.northeastern.edu/faculty/alexandra-to/). My research spans
at the intersection of HCI, AI transparency, Values informed design, and Human-centered Data Science. Currently, I am focusing on contributing to AI literacy
for marginalized or low-income communities. I am deeply passionate about making AI and data science knowledge more
accessible and widespread for everyone. My work has been published in premier HCI venues including ACM CHI, CSCW and DIS. In a previous life, I worked as a
lecturer in the CSE department, BRAC University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I completed my BS and MS (with highest distinction) in CSE from University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. I also
received a second MS degree in CS from Oregon State University. I love doing service work; for example, sometimes on the weekends, I am probably doing service work (e.g., reviewing, attending talks, admission committees). I have reviewed over 55+ conference and journal papers at premier HCI venues. In my free time, I like taking nature photographs.

## SELECTED RESEARCH PROJECTS
* ***Understanding Students Perception of Automated Job Hiring Algorithms (AHA) - Northeastern University***. (Fall 2022). Advisor: Varun Mishra \
Designing an online survey investigating students perceptions of AHA. Statistical analysis (e.g., t-test) showed media efficacy was positively correlated (p-value = 0.01383*) with AHA awareness.
MANOVA showed students educational level and gender was a strong predictor of AHA awareness
across STEM and non-STEM majors.
* ***Investigating Supervised Classification on Stress Recognition: The Case of SWELL-KW
Dataset - Northeastern University***. (Spring 2022). Advisor: Ehsan Elhamifar \
Experimenting with various ML algorithms (e.g., KNN with RBF kernel, DNN) on stress recognition
dataset. Identifed five optimal set of parameters for stress recognition through cross validation, which
produced similar results compared to the original feature set (50 parameters).
* ***BIPOC Flourishing Project - Northeastern University***. (Fall-2021 - Present). Advisor: Alexandra To \
Conducting in-depth literature reviews. Responsible for interview and co-design experimental study design. Managing team collaboration, focus group sessions and coordinating data analysis. Two paper(s) from this project is currently under
submission.
* ***Usability Evaluation of a Transformational Game - Northeastern University***. (Fall-2021).
Advisor: Timothy Beckhmore \
Designing an mixed-method experimental study. Game purpose is to help someone become an ally when someone experiencing gender microaggression. Finding indicate that the proposed evaluation method informed by game's central and supporting transformational goals (e.g, motivation, self-efficacy) efficiently captured the desired change in the player.
* ***The Application of ML/DL Algorithms on Various Dataset(s) - Lehigh University***. (Spring
2021). Advisor: Lifang He \
Experimenting with ML algorithms (KNN, SVM, CNN) on publicly available datasets (e.g., MNIST).
Using cross validation, KNN/SVM achieved on average 72% accuracy on cho/iyer tabular dataset, whereas, CNN outperformed KNN/SVM on MNIST image dataset (i.e., 98% accuracy).

## PERSONAL INTERESTS

I love pets; currently, I live with our apartment puppy, she's just adorable and provides a great escape from hectic life. I also love capturing nature photographs, especially sunsets and flowers! A glimpse of all these escapes I share in my digital diary [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ecstasyethereal/?hl=en).
